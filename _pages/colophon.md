ok bear with me.

#### the basic techy stuff
This is a static site generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). All my code and content sits comfy in a [Github](https://github.com) repository.
I developed this site on Windows 10 using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)... unsurprisingly, the documentation for this was difficult to navigate and troubleshoot until I stumbled upon [Virtual Goods Dealer](https://pages.virtualgoodsdealer.com/articles/2020/11/23/simple-website-tutorial-part-two/#windows-setting-up-bash). Note that this documentation is a little outdated. Be sure to reference the latest versions of packages mentioned. 
I use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to deploy my site and host it on my custom domain. A word of advice (since no tutorial cautioned me about this); if you're using a custom domain, deploy with netlify, not gh pages. I don't know the theory, but it just didn't work for me. Anyways...

#### the look
I used this [digital garden jekyll template](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) by Maxime Vaillancourt.
I actually didn't change much. Minor edits for fonts and colors were added to the `sass.cs` files. Colors and other supplementary things I'm playing with are going to get compiled in the [[playground]].


#### honorable mentions
1. I love the [jekyll bonsai template](https://jekyll-bonsai.netlify.app/post/0b9db15818/#clone) by manunamz, and originally tried using it for my own site. I ultimately decided against it (clearly) because I'm unsure if my garden is going to need so much metadata.
2. I also am a big fan of [tom critchlow's wiki](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) which runs on the code in [this repo](https://github.com/tomcritchlow/tomcritchlow.github.io)
3. definitely take the time to explore maggie appleton's [github repo](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) on digital gardening

#### disclaimer
*I have no web dev coding experience at all... unless you count tumblr html. However, I am a novice in bioinformatics so I started this endeavor with basic understanding of git, bash, and directory management. If you follow the [Virtual Goods Dealer](https://pages.virtualgoodsdealer.com/articles/2020/11/16/simple-website-tutorial-part-one/) static website tutorial from the beginning, I believe you will have all the basic understanding necessary to get your garden going. Otherwise, I am also here to help!* 

#### i'm learning!
This was sort of an endeavor I jumped into alone. I don't have anyone on call that's always going to answer my questions and help me debug. I spend a lot of time sifting through stackoverflow, but when I want to expedite the process, [chatgpt](chatgpt.openai.com) has been an insanely good resource.<br> With that said, this is both a functioning site and a learning activity for me... who knows if the it will ever have a final form. To keep up with my brain, you can always check out pieces that I'm working on building in my [[to do list]].
