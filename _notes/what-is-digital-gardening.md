[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) wrote a really good brief on digital gardening that convinced me to get started. The tldr is this:

1. transparent note-taking 
2. open source 
3. bi-directional links

The goal of digital gardening is to [create an environment that grows and evolves naturally over time](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) and by doing so, the need for perfect content is eradicated.

I'm also just a feind for long form content and I've been dissatisfied with current blogging platforms (but I will continue to maintain [mine](https://theruminant.substack.com/) for cohesive, developed prose). I also wanted a reason to dabble in html/css and I figure that the best way to learn is by doing (see my scatterbrained [[colophon]]). 

#### Here's a running list of digital gardens I enjoy:
1. [Alisa.wtf](https://alisa.wtf)
2. [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/)
3. [Maggie Appleton's digital gardening repo](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
4. [Nikita Voloboev's wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/)
5. [are.na board on 'creating digital gardens](https://www.are.na/annika-hansteen-izora/creating-digital-gardens)

#### And some references & tools for digital curation
1. [Tom Critchlow on Wikis](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/wikis/)
2. [neocities](https://neocities.org/) seems like a cool platform to host a garden (like [this](https://sonicyouth.neocities.org/))
3. [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is gaining a lot of traction on [tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@buggbuzz/video/7238276550540479786?lang=en&q=obsidian%20notes&t=1686180255795) i think... i haven't played around with it myself but it can definitely support a garden like platform
4. [notion](https://www.notion.so/) is a good platform for digital gardening, especially if you don't want to publically publish it (but there are options to make it public too!)
5. [are.na](https://are.na) is a great platform too for gardening and also just for personal web-keeping and moodboarding
