[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) wrote a really good brief on digital gardening that convinced me to get started. The tldr is this:

1. transparent note-taking 
2. open source 
3. bi-directional links

The goal of digital gardening is to [create an environment that grows and evolves naturally over time](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) and by doing so, the need for perfect content is eradicated.

I'm also just a feind for long form content and I've been dissatisfied with current blogging platforms (but I will continue to maintain [mine](https://theruminant.substack.com/) for cohesive, developed prose). I also wanted a reason to dabble in html/css and I figure that the best way to learn is by doing (see my scatterbrained [[colophon]]).
