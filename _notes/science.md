#### Things I'm interested in exploring more
1. Science communication: SciComm is a big deal in academia, but I believe it's still missing its target audience. What are the limitations of SciComm and how can we circumnavigate issues of accessibility and appeal?
2. Community science and what it takes to normalize open/recreational lab spaces (such as [GenSpaceNY](https://www.genspace.org/))
3. Science-art endeavors/residencies ([SVABioArt](https://bioart.sva.edu/))
