### I took a short workshop with [chia amisola](https://chia.design/) on websites created using google spreadsheets, html, and java
Here are the [notes/guides](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gLyh6gv41vl9H1fBmjFrGfKip9dKkvIu6o8sccTw2lY/edit#gid=1378489804) <br>
- <i> websites are a translation of data </i>
- <i> websites are an act of gathering </i>

#### ideas
- an intimate instagram: you can source information from a google form, where people can just add and contribute to the data
- it's an easy way to archive personal lists/archives
