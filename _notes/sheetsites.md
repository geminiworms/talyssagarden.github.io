### I took a short workshop with [chia amisola](https://chia.design/) on websites created using google spreadsheets, html, and java
Here is a copy of the [notes/guides](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UfKfW7ES5nxsXY-u1vv4PMQFtluku2oKsDdbmuUGaFw/edit?usp=sharing) <br>
- <i> websites are a translation of data </i>
- <i> websites are an act of gathering </i>

this is the sheetsite i built during the workshop: [talyssa's bookshelf](https://tt-readinglist-sheetsite.glitch.me/)

#### ideas
- an intimate instagram: you can source information from a google form, where people can just add and contribute to the data
- it's an easy way to archive personal lists/archives

#### inspiration from others' sheetsites
1. [this one which is a photo archive of skies](https://stupendous-aluminum-citrine.glitch.me/)
