#### Astrological Botany
> "The intrinsic connection between geometry, music and the earthly and astral realms has been contemplated by European philosophers and artists since antiquity.  Stretching back to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC, the idea of a ‘Music of the Spheres’ prevailed in Europe until the Renaissance – a correspondence across all aspects of the universe, an implicit harmony, mathematical in principal, figured as an act of music" | [camden art centre of london](https://www.botanicalmind.online/chapter-astrological-botany) <br>
