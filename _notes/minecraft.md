### i'm fascinated by the simulated open world and minecraft is kind of the quintessential case study
i've been ruminating on what minecraft *means* in the context of our behavioral patterns and the points at which participating in a virtual open world become pivotal to the manifestation of our *self*

#### notes
- walkable cities, communal spaces, ["the third place"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place); when we build minecraft servers, we naturally build a common space. in these microcosms, we recognize a need for center/hub
- deprioritizing functionality, build with intent to create-- reflecting on post-industrial architechture and the pattern that every building is made for optimal function and utility (office space, strip mall, family homes). we do not build for expression or cultural identity.
